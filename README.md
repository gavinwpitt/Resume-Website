# Terminal-Jerry
Termainl based snowboarding game. Follows Jerry, a self proclaimed 'steezy' rider, who shreds across the terminal.

This is a small project that I started, and never truly finished, on a ski trip with my friends.

It uses the ncurses C library to make terminal based animations. It currently only has a jump that jerry will 
automatically shred over. Jerry can also jump, but there is no practical function to that.

There is a print rail function for jerry to jump on, and it does have collision detection that would cause jerry to crash.
The rail, however, is not enabled in the while loop that prints everything.
